I am Hanyu Wang, a second-year PhD student at Penn State University, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jinghui Chen. Previously, I received my Bachelor of Science degree from the Department of Mathematics at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in June 2024.

My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Trustworthy AI. I am broadly interested in a range of topics aimed at making AI systems more capable and reliable, including:

* Understanding and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs.
* Enhancing the multi-step reasoning abilities of language models.
* Building agentic systems capable of complex planning and tool use.
