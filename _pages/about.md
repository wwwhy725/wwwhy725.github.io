Here is Hanyu Wang, and 王晗宇 in Chinese. I'm currently in the final year of my undergraduate study at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I major in Computational Mathematics and my research interests lie in the intersection of mathematics and artificial intelligence(AI). To be specific, I have a strong passion for machine learning theory and deep learning. Additionally, I find optimization, statistics, and operations research to be highly intriguing. 

Currently, my research is centered on generative models, with a specific emphasis on diffusion models.
