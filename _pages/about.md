Here is Hanyu Wang, and 王晗宇 in Chinese. Currently, I'm in the final year of undergrad at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I major in computational mathematics and my research interests lie in the intersection of mathematics and AI. To be specific, I am exactly interested in machine learning theory and deep learning. Optimization, statistics, and operation research are also attractive to me.
