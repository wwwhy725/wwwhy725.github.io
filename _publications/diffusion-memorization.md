title: "On the Discrepancy and Connection between Memorization and Generation in Diffusion Models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/diffusion-memorization
excerpt: 'We address the paradox in diffusion models where the theoretical optimal score suggests memorization while trained models generalize, attributing generalization to the superior geometric smoothness of the trained score function.'
