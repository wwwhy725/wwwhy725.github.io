To USTCers Who Want to Learn Computational Mathematics
==============

I'm gonna announce a piece of exciting news that I, jointly with some of my friends, have almost finished the guidance -- 'Guideline for Computational Mathematics' for freshmen and sophomores to decide whether to select computational mathematics as their future major. The official release is scheduled for spring 2024. Stay tuned!

Motivation
----------
Our motivation is really simple -- the conflict between the increasing number of students who choose computational mathematics as their major and the lack of proper and timely guidance to tell them what computational mathematics actually is. Consequently, some students blindly follow suit or find it has little to do with computer science which is thought to be promising in terms of making money though they have 'compute' in common. Thus we made joint efforts to bridge the gap so that the freshmen and sophomores can benefit from the guideline. 

About the guideline
-------------------
The guideline includes three parts: 
* An introduction to the mainstream directions of computational mathematics
* An introduction to professional courses in USTC
* Some tips on studying and doing research
