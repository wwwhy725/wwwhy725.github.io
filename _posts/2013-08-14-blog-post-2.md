Life in USTC
============
Actually, the moment you enter the gate of USTC, you kind of lose the colorful college life which might ever exist in your mind. If you are a boring person and your satisfaction completely comes from academic work, anime, and PC games, you are a perfect fit for USTC. Hefei is boring. The campus is boring. Most of your schoolmates are boring...... If you have a strong need to socialize, you will endure four years of relative hardship at this school.

Interests
----------
You can find a little sparkle in even the dullest of lives.
