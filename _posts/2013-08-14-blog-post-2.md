Life in USTC
============
Actually, the moment you enter the gate of USTC, you kind of lose the colorful college life that might ever exist in your mind. If you are a boring person and your satisfaction completely comes from academic work, anime, and PC games, you are a perfect fit for USTC. Hefei is boring. The campus is boring. Most of your schoolmates are boring...... If you have a strong need to socialize, you will endure four years of relative hardship at this school.

<!--The first and the most important tip to bear in mind, I reckon, is to  gain the ability to 'ignore'. Ignore the bias, the prejudice, the scoff, the misunderstanding. The only thing you have to pursue is to be yourself. The campus of a college should be inclusive. -->
Actually, you can have fun as long as you have time and willingness. There are quite a few clubs, ranging from art and culture to sports. Although there are few active members in the clubs, you do make friends if you participate in the activities frequently.

I have a passion for nightfall. I thoroughly enjoy the mixture of pink, red, orange, and yellow spraying on the earth. When everything is covered by the beauty of these fleeting moments, I feel like touching the most magnificent part of life, which reversely touches the deepest romance in my heart.

Why not arm yourself with the coolest 'mathematical and physical knowledge'? Please hug the world. Life is far more than academic books, homework, and experiments. Fun can be found everywhere, as long as you feel it with your full heart.

Relax. And make peace with yourself.
